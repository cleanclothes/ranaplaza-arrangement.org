The method of calculating the awards was designed in accordance with the principles of ILO Employment Injury Benefits Convention No. 121.

The formula took into consideration each individual's particular circumstances. Therefore, variables such as  the age of the beneficiary, the number of dependents that each claim must cover, the wage earned by the killed or injured worker and the extent of injury suffered in the case of survivors were all factors that influenced the value of the award.

See the [exact parameters of the formula](RanaPlaza-Arrangement-Calculation-Formula.pdf)

Payments made under the Arrangement were designed to compensate the specific and concrete losses experiences by families affected by Rana Plaza; they were never intended to improve the financial circumstances of low wage families, nor to address economic inequality between lower and higher paid workers. Nor were these payments intended to compensate for the pain and suffering of the families affected; such payments would need to be sought via legal actions against those responsible for the disaster. The payments made under the Arrangement we done without prejudice to any such legal action.
