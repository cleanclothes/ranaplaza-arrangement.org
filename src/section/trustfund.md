title: The Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund
path: "/trustfund/"
---

The Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund was established in January 2014 by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in order to collect contributions and to hold them in trust under specified Terms and Conditions.  It was agreed that $30 million would be required to cover all awards, a figure developed on the basis of the actual claims forms submitted by eligible beneficiaries. 

The Fund reached its target in June 2015. The majority of the $30 million collected was contributed by international clothing brands, with significant contributions from the Bangladesh Prime Ministers Fund and anonymous donors as well as small individual donations. These contributions were used exclusively to cover payments to Rana Plaza victims and their families, to provide medical services to those injures, and cover operating costs.

## Direct payments to beneficiaries recognized under the coordinated scheme

The following donors made direct payments to Rana Plaza victims which were recognized by the Coordination Committee as payments for losses under the terms of the Arrangement:

- **Prime Ministers Relief and Welfare Fund (Bangladesh)**: The PRWF is a standing fund established to provide support to Bangladeshi’s impacted by a range of disasters.  Following the Rana Plaza disasters donations were made to the fund from Bangladeshi and international donors including a donation from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. The PRWF paid out around $3million of those donations to injured survivors and families of those killed at Rana Plaza,

- **Primark**:  Primark decided to launch their own separate scheme to provide loss of income payments for workers employed at New Wave Bottoms, one of the Rana Plaza factories where they were the main buyer. The scheme was monitored by the ILO to ensure it met the same standards as the awards provided via the Arrangement. A total of $12,491,009.73 was given to 1154 beneficiaries under this scheme.

## Total amount received for victims and their families

Victims and families of the Rana Plaza disaster received just over $34 million in loss of income payments from schemes recognized under the Arrangement.  The  Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund paid out US$ 18,468,277.95, which was supplemented by the $12,491,009.73 paid by Primark to those employees killed and injured at their supplier, New Wave Bottoms and a further $3,050,074.29 paid out in the immediate aftermath of the disaster by the Prime Ministers Relief and Welfare Fund.
