The Claims  Commissioners provided a quasi judicial feature to ensure due process was following in the establishment and delivery of the Arrangement. The Commissioners were responsible for determining the amount of compensation to be awarded to each claimant within the framework agreed upon by the Coordination Committee. They oversaw and certify the correctness and independence of the claims processing and the work of the claims review team.

Their work included making decisions on particular aspects of the process that needed to be in line with local law (for example the definition of dependents for the purposes of the claim), liaising with government and local officials and recommending and arranging service providers for different elements of the scheme. The Commissioners were also responsible for dealing with unusual or difficult cases where the circumstances of a particular claimant of beneficiaries fell outside of the normal parameters of the scheme.

The Rana Plaza Coordination appointed one international and two national Commissioners, all of whom were highly respected lawyers with significant experience and expertise in international and national law.
