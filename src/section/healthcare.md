The Arrangement also addressed health care needs of victims injured in the accident.  A medical assessment by qualified doctors exercising independent professional judgment projected the required care that would allow victims to  attain pre-injury health condition or maximum recovery.

Two separate schemes were then set up under the Arrangement, to ensure ongoing medical treatment.

For those workers with a more serious permanent disablement arrangements were made with the Bangladesh NGO BRAC, who were provided with $1 million to provide medical treatment to 92 workers for a period of 5 years.

## Trust for Injured Workers Medical Care

The remaining injured workers, who continue to suffer from permanent, but less disabling injuries, will be provided with referrals and treatment through a medical trust established to provide ongoing support to workers effected by workplace injury.

The Trust for Injured Workers Medical Care (TIWMC) was established in October 2016 and is now running weekly drop in sessions with doctors, running regular medical camps and refering workers for specialist medical care, all of which is funded by the Trust. It is oversee by a board chaired by the Ministry of Labour and Employments, and which includes all the national bodies represented on the original Rana Plaza Coordination Committee.

A specific project has been set up under this Trust to provide support to those workers injured  at Rana Plaza, work which will be funded from money remaining in the Rana Plaza Trust Fund.
